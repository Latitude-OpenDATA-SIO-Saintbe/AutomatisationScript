# Automatisation Script Project
 
This repository contains a set of Bash and PowerShell scripts designed to automate the installation and configuration of various services, including Apache, Docker (with Portainer), Firewall, GLPI, and more.
Project Structure

## The project is organized into directories for different operating systems and services. Each service or tool has its own dedicated script for easy installation and configuration.

```bash

.
├── bash
│   ├── apache
│   │   └── script.sh           # Script to install Apache
│   ├── docker
│   │   └── script.sh           # Script to install Docker and Portainer
│   ├── firewall
│   │   └── script.sh           # Script to configure Firewall
│   ├── glpi
│   │   └── script.sh           # Script to install GLPI
│   └── script.sh               # Main installation script
└── windows
    └── script.ps1              # PowerShell script for Windows-based tasks
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure the following:

    You have sudo privileges on your system.
    You are running a supported operating system (Linux or Windows).
    For Linux, these scripts assume a Debian-based distribution (like Ubuntu) and use apt for package management.

## Installation Guide
### Linux

The main script allows you to choose which service you want to install, and it will run the appropriate installation script.

    Clone the repository:

```bash

git clone https://github.com/Latitude-OpenDATA-SIO-Saintbe/AutomatisationScript.git
cd AutomatisationScript
```

Make the scripts executable:

```bash
chmod +x bash/*/script.sh
chmod +x bash/script.sh
```

Run the main installation script:

```bash

    bash bash/script.sh
```

    Follow the prompt: The script will ask you to choose the service you want to install:
        Apache
        Docker (with Portainer)
        Firewall
        GLPI

    Type the number corresponding to your choice, and the script will automatically install and configure the selected service.

Service-Specific Installation

You can also run the individual scripts for each service directly, bypassing the prompt.
Apache Installation

To install Apache only:

```bash

bash bash/apache/script.sh
```

Docker Installation (with Portainer)

To install Docker and launch Portainer:

```bash

bash bash/docker/script.sh
```

Firewall Configuration

To configure the firewall:

```bash

bash bash/firewall/script.sh
```

GLPI Installation

To install GLPI:

```bash

bash bash/glpi/script.sh
```

### Windows

For Windows users, a PowerShell script is provided for automation tasks specific to Windows environments.

    Run the PowerShell script:

```powershell

    ./windows/script.ps1
```
